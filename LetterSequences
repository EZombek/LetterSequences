# THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT ENTIRELY WORK YET #

# Get users word or phrase
message = input("type in a word or phrase: ")

# Create the alphabet variable
alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

count = 0

# Loop through each letter of the alphabet
for i in range(0, len(alphabet)):
	# Assign letter to each letter every time the program loops
	letter = alphabet[i]

	# Loop through the user input to see how many of each letter
	# is in the word/phrase, then increment it by 1
	for i in range(0, len(message)):
		if letter == message[i]:
			count += 1
		else:
			count == 0

	# Print out each letter, and how many times it is repeated
	if count > 0:
		print ("There are ",count," instances of", letter)
